    "Test statistic: The test statistic for the Shapiro-Wilk test is 0.792026162147522. This value represents the calculated test statistic based on the data.\n",

    "p-value: The p-value for the Shapiro-Wilk test is 2.812811387868261e-19. The p-value is a measure of the evidence against the null hypothesis. In this case, the extremely small p-value suggests strong evidence to reject the null hypothesis.\n",

    "Power: The power of the test is 0.055. The power represents the probability of correctly rejecting the null hypothesis when it is false. In this case, the low power value suggests that the test has a low ability to detect departures from the null hypothesis, assuming that such departures exist.\n",
